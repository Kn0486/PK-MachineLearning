## Machine Learning application on Pharmacokinetic modelling 

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become game changers for predictive modeling and forecasting across diverse domains in both academia and industry. The pharmaceutical field is no exception - researchers are actively exploring the potential for ML/AI to advance pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling. By learning from data, ML/AI promises more accurate and robust predictions to optimize dosing regimens and support efficient drug development.

In particular, ML/AI-based PK/PD modeling aims to improve upon traditional nonlinear mixed effects models in several respects. ML techniques can uncover complex nonlinear relationships in PK/PD datasets that evade traditional parameterized models. They can also integrate diverse parameters - demographic, genetic, phenotypic - that impact drug disposition and response. Additionally, ML-based models require fewer simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology and can continually update their knowledge through ongoing training on new clinical data.

In this article, we will explore applications of ML on Pharmakinetic modelling, and compare such methods with the traditional non linear mixed effect models method. We will compare the strengths and limitations of data-driven ML modeling versus traditional compartmental and physiological modeling approaches through some select examples.
